For the first few weeks of small groups, I was instructed by my project lead to learn JavaScript. I did so through a JS4Python (JavaScript for Python Programmers) tutorial online. The first part of the tutorial covered the basics of the JavaScript language. This included what JavaScript is and why and when it is useful, conditionals, loops and iterative programming, data types, and collections. Afterwards, there was a set of exercises to test my knowledge. Six of the exercises are included in a separate JavaScript document (tutorial-exercises.js). The second part of the tutorial focused on object oriented programming and covered classes and class inheritance. This section also included a set of exercises that I did, but I did not include them in the document because they built off of previous code and would not run independently. The third part of the course covered closures and scopes of variables and the differences in their scope depending on how they were defined. This section did not feature any exercises. The fourth and final section covered HTML and how it plays with JavaScript. There were a few exercises in this section that I completed, but they are not included because they deal with data and information exclusive to a specific page of the website and would not run independently. Overall, this tutorial was extremely useful in learning JavaScript. The information was presented neatly and explained well, and the tutorial did its job, as I, as primarily a Python programmer, was able to learn and follow along. The exercises were fairly straightforward but were a good test of knowledge, and helped me to get used to working in the language and the differences from both Python and Java.
